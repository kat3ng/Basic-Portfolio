        <p> Hello there! My name is Kat. Growing up as the second youngest of 9, my childhood took place between Monty
            Python movies and
            Simpson references. Any and all taste can be attributed to my mother who is a gorgeous former flower child
            and my
            quirks to my father who somehow landed her despite being a text book nerd. I currently work and live on the
            West
            side. In my spare time I enjoy reading, eating delicious food and doting on my plants. I am taking this
            full stack course in hopes that I will be able to add the full stack knowledge and vernacular into a
            tenchnical project or product manager position! </p>
