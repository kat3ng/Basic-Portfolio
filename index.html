        "Hey there! My name is Kat. Growing up as the second youngest of 9, my childhood took place between Monty Python movies and
        Simpson references. Any and all taste can be attributed to my mother who is a gorgeous former flower child and my
        quirks to my father who somehow landed her despite being a text book nerd. I currently work and live on the West
        side. In my spare time I enjoy reading, eating delicious food and doting on my plants. I am attending this boot camp
        because I am looking to add to my skill set and expand career opportunities in the future. Pleasure to make your
        acquaintance!"
